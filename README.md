# mathGenius

A fun little computer game to help youngsters practice their math skills in an exciting and interesting way. Made for my little sister to help her out through elementary school and hopefully for many more years to come as well!

So far, the game has four difficulty options: 

 - Easy (up to 5)
 - Medium (up to 10)
 - Hard (up to 25)
 - Genius (up to 100). 

At the moment, mathGenius only asks addition based questions but I am hoping to add subtraction, multiplacation, and division in the near future.

Give it a shot, even if you are already a math-Genius! ;)
