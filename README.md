# mathGenius

A fun little computer game to help youngsters practice their math skills in an exciting and interesting way. Made for my little sister to help her out through elementary school and hopefully for many more years to come as well!

So far, the game has four difficulty options: 

 - Easy (Numbers from 1 up to 5)
 - Medium (Numbers from 1 up to 10)
 - Hard (Numbers from 5 up to 25)
 - Genius (Numbers from 10 up to 100). 

In addition, mathGenius is able to ask addition/subtraction/multiplication/division based questions with a mixed goodie-bag quiz mode coming in the near future.

Give it a shot, even if you are already a math-Genius! ;)
